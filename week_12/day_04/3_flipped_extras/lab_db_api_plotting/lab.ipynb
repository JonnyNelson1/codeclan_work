    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "***Important note: The data in this lab has been synthesised to provide a reasonable challenge. Do not take it as representative of the socioeconomic conditions of the countries and regions involved!***\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been contracted by the Acme Corporation to perform analysis of their employee numbers and salaries. They have made their `acme_pool` database available to you in **read-only mode** (see the connection details below), and suggest that you will need the `employees` and `pay_details` tables in that database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in `Python`, `SQL` and `pandas`, they want you to try to answer the following questions below. Ideally, for each question, they would like to see: **an appropriate table and a useful visualisation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Question 1. How many employees work in each country?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "* A basic answer to this requires just the `employees` table, but to get proper country names, you'll need to make request(s) to the API mentioned in Question 2 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Question 2. What is the distribution of salary by region?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each employees' salary is held in the `pay_details` table.\n",
    "* Each employees' country is held as a standard three-letter code in the `employees` table.\n",
    "* AcmeCorp suggest using the `restcountries.eu` API to gather additional details of countries beyond just the country codes held in `acme_pool`. \n",
    "* A responsible use of this API would be to fetch details **only for those countries in which AcmeCorp employees actually work** (rather than all countries in the world). To do this, have a look at either the `Code` or `List of codes` API endpoints (see the API documentation for more details).\n",
    "* The API response for each country will include the **country name**, **code** and **region** (the value of interest for this Question), as well as the **Gini coefficient** (see Question 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension Question\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have time, AcmeCorp would also like you to answer the following Question, again with **an appropriate table and visualisation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Question 3. Does salary distribution show any dependence on the Gini coefficient of a country?***\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Gini coefficient is a measure of **income inequality**. A value of 1 or 100% corresponds to maximal inequality (e.g. one person in a country has all the income or wealth, everyone else has nothing), while a value of zero corresponds to perfect equality.\n",
    "* The Gini coefficient is among the values returned for each country by the `restcountries.eu` API\n",
    "* [**Hint**] would a **statistical measure of spread** in salary (e.g. standard deviation, variance, interquartile range) be useful here?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to proceed\n",
    "\n",
    "* If this gives you enough information and you are ready to go, then good luck! The connection parameters for the `acme_pool` database are below! You can dip into the workthrough below if you get stuck.\n",
    "* If you would prefer more guidance as you work, we have provided a workthrough in which to code your steps of the analysis.\n",
    "* You may wish to use `DBeaver` to do some initial exploration of the `acme_pool` database. Remember, you can see the relationships between all tables by double clicking on the `public` schema and selecting the `ER Diagram` tab.\n",

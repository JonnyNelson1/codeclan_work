```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}

read_csv("")

# (~) can then read from all files

# But this is not good for reproducibility, it uses the absolute file path.

```

```{r}

getwd()

# Gives you were the working directory is.

```

```{r}
library(here)

# test where the top level of the project directory is

here::here()

# Use this to set the path to the data file

read_csv(here("../3_relative_filepaths/no_project_example/data/students.csv/"))

# "../" to move one out of the current file we are working within

# here() function allows you to make the code more reproducible

```
